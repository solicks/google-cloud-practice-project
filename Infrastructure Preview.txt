#  Task 1: Use Marketplace to build a deployment

    Google Cloud Practice Project

     1. In the Cloud Console, on the Navigation menu (7a91d354499ac9f1.png), click Marketplace.

     2. Locate the Jenkins deployment by searching for Jenkins Certified by Bitnami.

     3. Click on the deployment and read about the service provided by the software.


    Launch Jenkins

     1. Click Launch.

     2. Verify the deployment, accept the terms and services and click Deploy.

     3. Click Close on the Welcome to Deployment Manager window.


#  Task 2: Examine the deployment   
    
    View installed software and login to Jenkins
     
     1. In the right pane, click More about the software to view additional software details. Look at all the software that was installed.

     2. Copy the Admin user and Admin password values to a text editor.

     3. Click Visit the site to view the site in another browser tab. If you get an error, you might have to reload the page a couple of times.

     4. Log in with the Admin user and Admin password values.

     5. After logging in, you will be asked to Customize Jenkins. Click Install suggested plugins, and then click Restart after the installation is complete. The restart will take a couple of minutes.

    
    Explore Jenkins

     1. In the Jenkins interface, in the left pane, click Manage Jenkins. Look at all of the actions available. 
        You are now prepared to manage Jenkins. 
        The focus of this lab is Google Cloud infrastructure, not Jenkins management, 
        so seeing that this menu is available is the purpose of this step.

    2. Leave the browser window open to the Jenkins service. You will use it in the next task.


#  Task 3: Administer the service

     View the deployment and SSH to the VM
      
      1. In the Cloud Console, on the Navigation menu, click Deployment Manager.

      2. Click jenkins-1.

      3. Click SSH to connect to the Jenkins server.

    Shut down and restart the services

     1. In the SSH window, enter the following command to shut down all the running services:
          sudo /opt/bitnami/ctlscript.sh stop

     2. Refresh the browser window for the Jenkins UI. You will no longer see the Jenkins interface because the service was shut down.

     3. In the SSH window, enter the following command to restart the services:
          sudo /opt/bitnami/ctlscript.sh restart

     4. Return to the browser window for the Jenkins UI and refresh it. You may have to do it a couple of times before the service is reachable.

     5. In the SSH window, type exit to close the SSH terminal session.
