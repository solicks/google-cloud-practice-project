##  Console and Cloud Shell

#  Objectives
In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

Get access to Google Cloud.

Create a Cloud Storage bucket using the Cloud Console.

Create a Cloud Storage bucket using Cloud Shell.

Become familiar with Cloud Shell features.

##  Task 1: Create a bucket using the Cloud Console

    --  In the Cloud Console, on the Hambuger Menu, click Storage > Browser.
    --  Click Create bucket.
    --  Name the bucket [myfirstnew-bucket], and leave all other values as their defaults.
    --  Click Create.
    --  Click the notification icon to see additional information and history. 

##  Task 2: Access Cloud Shell

    Open Cloud Shell and explore features

    --  In the Google Cloud menu, click Activate Cloud Shell button. If prompted, click Continue. Cloud Shell opens at the bottom of the Cloud Console window.
        -- There are three icons to the far right of the Cloud Shell toolbar:
           --  Minimize/Restore: The first one minimize and restores the window, giving you full access to the Cloud Console without closing Cloud Shell.
           --  Open in new window: Having Cloud Shell at the bottom of the Cloud Console is useful when you are issuing individual commands.
           --  Close terminal: This icon closes Cloud Shell. Every time you close Cloud Shell, the virtual machine is recycled and all machine context is lost.
    --  Close Cloud Shell now.


##  Task 3: Create a bucket using Cloud Shell

    Create a second bucket and verify in the Cloud Console

    -- Open Cloud Shell again.
    -- Use the gsutil command to create another bucket.
       gsutil mb gs://mysecond-new-bucket
    -- To see the second bucket click on Refresh or In the Cloud Console, on the Navigation menu, click Storage > Browser


##  Task 4: Explore more Cloud Shell features
    
    Upload a file
    
    -- Open Cloud Shell.
    -- Click the three dots icon in the Cloud Shell toolbar to display further options.
    -- Click Upload file. Upload any file from your local machine to the Cloud Shell VM.
        [My-Responsive-portfolio]
    -- In Cloud Shell, type ls to confirm that the file was uploaded.
       ls
    -- Copy the file into one of the buckets you created earlier in the lab. 
        gsutil cp [My-Responsive-portfolio] gs://[mysecond-new-bucket]  
    -- Explore the options available in Cloud Shell by clicking on different icons in the Cloud Shell toolbar.
    -- Close all the Cloud Shell sessions.


##  Task 5: Create a persistent state in Cloud Shell

    Identify available regions

    -- Open Cloud Shell from the Cloud Console. Note that this allocates a new VM for you.
    -- To list available regions, execute the following command:
        gcloud compute regions list
    -- Select a region from the list and note the value in any text editor. This region will now be referred to as [YOUR_REGION] in the remainder of the lab.


    Create and verify an environment variable

    -- Create an environment variable and replace [YOUR_REGION] with the region you selected in the previous step:
        INFRACLASS_REGION=[YOUR_REGION]
    -- Verify it with echo:
         echo $INFRACLASS_REGION 


    Append the environment variable to a file

    --  Create a subdirectory for materials used in this class:
         mkdir infraclass

    --  Create a file called config in the infraclass directory:
         touch infraclass/config

    --  Append the value of your Region environment variable to the config file:
         echo INFRACLASS_REGION=$INFRACLASS_REGION >> ~/infraclass/config

    --  Create a second environment variable for your Project ID, replacing [YOUR_PROJECT_ID] with your Project ID. You can find the project ID on the Cloud Console Home page.
         INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID=[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]

    --  Append the value of your Project ID environment variable to the config file:
         echo INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID=$INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID >> ~/infraclass/config

    --  Use the source command to set the environment variables, and use the echo command to verify that the project variable was set:
         source infraclass/config
         echo $INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID 

    --  Close and re-open Cloud Shell. Then issue the echo command again:
          echo $INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID
            There will be no output because the enviroment variable no longer exist.

    Modify the bash profile and create persistence

    --  Edit the shell profile with the following command:
          nano .profile

    --  Add the following line to the end of the file:
         source infraclass/config

    --  Press Ctrl+O, ENTER to save the file, and then press Ctrl+X to exit nano.

    --  Close and then re-open Cloud Shell to cycle the VM.

    --  Use the echo command to verify that the variable is still set:
          echo $INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID
            You should see the expected value
